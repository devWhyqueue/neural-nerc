Named Entity Recognition with Classification (NERC) is the task of identifying named entities in text and assigning them category labels. This report presents a neural network approach to NERC in the context of pharmacological text, specifically recognizing and classifying drug names in biomedical documents. We describe a bidirectional LSTM neural network that learns from word sequences with additional suffix features to predict BIO-formatted entity labels. The model is trained and evaluated on a standard benchmark dataset of drug--drug interaction (DDI) articles. We outline the system architecture, data preprocessing steps, and training procedure, highlighting which parts of the provided code were modified according to the task specifications. Experimental results show that the neural NER model achieves strong performance (around 68\% F$_1$ score on the test set) in extracting drug name entities, outperforming a previous classical machine learning baseline. We include analyses of the model's behavior and discuss enhancements such as embedding initialization and additional features. The approach demonstrates the effectiveness of neural networks for NERC in biomedical text while maintaining a precise and reproducible methodology.

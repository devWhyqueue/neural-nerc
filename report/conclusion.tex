\section{Conclusion}
We have developed a neural network-based NERC system for identifying and classifying drug names in text. The BiLSTM model with word and suffix embeddings achieved an F$_1$ around 68\% on the standard DDI test set, markedly improving over a feature-engineered baseline. This result approaches the performance of the best systems in the original challenge, demonstrating the power of deep learning in this domain. We carefully respected the constraints on code modifications, altering only the model-specific sections to implement our network, and leaving the data processing and evaluation code as given. The final code is well-documented, highlighting the changes made and the reasoning behind them.

In future work, we could refine this model by incorporating character-level modeling and CRF-based decoding to further improve accuracy. Another extension could be to integrate this NER model into a pipeline for extracting drug--drug interactions (the second subtask of DDIExtraction), showcasing end-to-end information extraction from biomedical text. Overall, this project illustrates how a neural approach can be applied to NER tasks with minimal manual feature design and achieve high performance through learning from data.
